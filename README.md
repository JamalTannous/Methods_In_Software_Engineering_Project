#Automated Misconfiguration & Threat Detection
#Rule-Based Cloud Storage Misconfiguration Detection System

This repository contains the implementation of a rule-based system for detecting security misconfigurations in cloud storage resources.
The system evaluates normalized, provider-agnostic storage configurations against predefined best-practice rules and produces structured, explainable findings with severity and remediation guidance.

The project was developed as part of an academic Software Engineering project and demonstrates requirements analysis, architectural design, low-level design, implementation, and validation.
